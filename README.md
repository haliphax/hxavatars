# 👾 hxAvatars

A static site stream overlay that represents your chat as animated sprites.

# 🎥 Using the overlay

Visit https://haliphax.github.io/hxavatars to either build an overlay URL for
yourself or to view a demonstration (with no chat integration and a fixed
background color).

# 🎲 Commands

The following commands are available from the overlay's chat integration, with
more to come:

| Command           | Description                                  |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `!avatar <value>` | Sets the user's avatar (if the value exists) |

# 🏠 Running it yourself

If you have a web server of your own, you will need to serve the contents of
the `html` folder. That's it!

You can also host it yourself by using `docker-compose`. It will spin up an
instance of the [Traefik] load balancer (for managing hostname association
and HTTPS certificates) and the [nginx] web server (for serving the files).
By default, it will be available at https://localhost.

```shell
docker-compose up
```

## 🐧 WSL (Windows)

If you are running the system with docker on WSL, it is likely that you will
not be able to use `localhost` as the hostname for the web application. In this
case, add a [hosts file] mapping for `avatars.localdomain` to the WSL system's
address. (Use `ip addr` and check the output for `eth0` in most cases.) Copy
the `wsl.yml` file to a new `docker-compose.override.yml` file. This file will
be automatically merged with the base configuration at runtime.

```shell
cp wsl.yml docker-compose.override.yml
docker-compose up
```

You may craft an override file with a different hostname if you just want to
use something other than `localhost`, of course; you don't have to be using WSL
to take advantage of this.
